/* The construction activity began the very next day, on 24 October 1505, when Goncalo Gil Barbosa - the Portuguese factor 
of Cannanore (Kannur) - laid the foundation stone. The construction of the wooden fort was completed on 30 October 1505: its first Captain 
was Lourenco Britto, who led a garrison of 150 Portuguese men, and controlled two ships in the sea. After the fort was completed, Almeida 
began using the title "Viceroy", and in 1507, he started the construction of a stone fort at the site. */
