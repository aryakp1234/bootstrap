                       <p class="p2"> Kadhakali is a traditional form of classical Indian dance, and one of the oldest theater forms still practiced.
                        It is a "story game" genre of art, but one distinguished by the elaborately colourful make-up and costumes of the traditional male actor-dancers.
                        It  is almost entirely practiced by Malayali people.The roots of Kathakali are unclear.
