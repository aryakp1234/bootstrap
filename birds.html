                <p class="p1">Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves ,characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, 
                    the laying of hard-shelled eggs, 
                    a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. 
                    Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. 
                    There are over 11,000 living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds.Birds have wings whose development 
                    varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are
                    modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and 
                    diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of
                     aquatic environments, 
                    particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology. </p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 ml-2">
                <p class="p2"> Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern 
                cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans
                which first appeared during the Late Jurassic. According to recent estimates, modern birds 
                evolved in the Late Cretaceous and diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago, 
                which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of 
                culture. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and 
                hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for 
                one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. </p>

                        Sparrows are a small type of brown or gray bird that look like finches. You can identify sparrows by the black streaked markings on their
                         back, small chubby size, and round head. American tree sparrows (scientific name Spizelloides arborea) has a distinctive bicolored, 
                         conical bill.<br>The common house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is commonly found in Europe. As with most species of sparrow, house sparrows 
                         are known for their chirping sounds and hopping behavior as they look for seeds and grains to eat.The house sparrow is strongly associated 
                         with human habitation, and can live in urban or rural settings. Though found in widely varied habitats and climates, it typically avoids
                          extensive woodlands, grasslands, polar regions, and hot, dry deserts far away from human development. For sustenance, the house sparrow 
                          routinely feeds at home and public bird feeding stations, but naturally feeds on the seeds of grains, flowering plants and weeds. However,
                           it is an opportunistic, omnivorous eater, and commonly catches insects, their larvae, caterpillars, invertebrates and many other natural 
                           foods.Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and association with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent.   <br>

                             Sparrows tend to fly in small flocks.

                    <p class="p4">All kinds of birds belong to the animal class Aves which is in the phylum Chordata. There are an estimated 18,000 species of birds and 
                    they live on all continents in the world. Birds are classified by the fact they are warm-blooded vertebrates, have 2 legs, feathers, wings, 
                    and bills. Because they don't have mammary glands or give birth to their young, birds aren't a type of mammal.Individual bird species are 
                    classified by the similarities they have with each other. For example, different types of birds have excellent navigation skills. 
                    Some migratory birds travel hundreds of thousands of miles every year to the same nesting site. Some species of birds are known by their 
                    chirping sounds or song-like melodies. Even some types of parrots and blue jays are expert at mimicking sounds and human language'</p>

                            The smallest pigeons can be the size of a house sparrow and the largest species can be almost the size of
